When a cookie is protected with the secure attribute set to true it will not be send by the browser over an unencrypted HTTP request and thus cannot be observed by an unauthorized person during a man-in-the-middle attack.


###### Ask Yourself Whether

    the cookie is for instance a session-cookie not designed to be sent over non-HTTPS communication.
    itâ€™s not sure that the website contains mixed content or not (ie HTTPS everywhere or not)

There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.
Sensitive Code Example

If you create a security-sensitive cookie in your JAVA code:

Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setSecure(false);  // Sensitive: a security-ensitive cookie is created with the secure flag set to false

By default the secure flag is set to false:

Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);  // Sensitive: a security-sensitive cookie is created with the secure flag not defined (by default set to false)




######## Recommended Secure Coding Practices

    It is recommended to use HTTPs everywhere so setting the secure flag to true should be the default behaviour when creating cookies.
    Set the secure flag to true for session-cookies.

Compliant Solution

Cookie c = new Cookie(COOKIENAME, sensitivedata);
c.setSecure(true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie will not be send during an unencrypted HTTP request thanks to the secure flag set to true
